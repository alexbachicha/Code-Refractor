# Honey, I refracted my homework!

But in actuality, I did. I built this project in the hopes of gaining a better understanding of building a webpage and having it accessable to users everywhere. I am new to the coding world and am just starting out my journey in the quest for knowledge. Web accessability is something that all web developers need to keep in mind when creating a project, and is especially important in the consideration for businesses. Not only did I learn about how to approach starting a project, I learned how to efficiently prioritize where I put my time and effort. This was a very fun yet complicated first assignment and I'm proud of what I was able to accomplish in such little time.

My code contains the following, based on criteria that meets accessability standards:

WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
